# OutClickEventWrapper

The component `OutClickEventWrapper` tells you if a click was inside or outside all of its childrens.

For a usage case, It can be very useful when implementing a `dropdown` component from scratch, where you need to know if a click event was outside the component itself (then the dropdown's list get closed, for example).

## Sample

```typescript
import React from "react";
import { OutClickEventWrapper } from 'react-event-handler-wrapper';
```
<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story story={stories.OutClickEvent}/>
</Canvas>
